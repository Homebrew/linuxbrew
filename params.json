If a formula doesn't work, [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Homebrew/linuxbrew/issues) or, even better, submit a pull request.\r\n\r\n## Security\r\nPlease report security issues to security@brew.sh.\r\n\r\nThis is our PGP key which is valid until June 17, 2016.\r\n* Key ID: `0xE33A3D3CCE59E297`\r\n* Fingerprint: `C657 8F76 2E23 441E C879  EC5C E33A 3D3C CE59 E297`\r\n* Full key: https://keybase.io/homebrew/key.asc\r\n\r\n## Who Are You?\r\nLinuxbrew is maintained by [Shaun Jackman](https://github.com/sjackman).\r\n\r\nHomebrew's current maintainers are [Misty De Meo](https://github.com/mistydemeo), [Adam Vandenberg](https://github.com/adamv), [Xu Cheng](https://github.com/xu-cheng), [Mike McQuaid](https://github.com/mikemcquaid), [Baptiste Fontaine](https://github.com/bfontaine), [Brett Koonce](https://github.com/asparagui), [Dominyk Tiller](https://github.com/DomT4), [Tim Smith](https://github.com/tdsmith) and [Alex Dunn](https://github.com/dunn).\r\n\r\nHomebrew was originally created by [Max Howell](https://github.com/mxcl).\r\n\r\n## License\r\nCode is under the [BSD 2 Clause (NetBSD) license](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/tree/master/LICENSE.txt).\r\nDocumentation is under the [Creative Commons Attribution license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\r\n\r\n## Sponsors\r\nOur CI infrastructure was paid for by [our Kickstarter supporters](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/SUPPORTERS.md).\r\n\r\nOur CI infrastructure is hosted by [The Positive Internet Company](http://www.positive-internet.com).\r\n\r\nOur bottles (binary packages) are hosted by Bintray.\r\n\r\n[![Downloads by Bintray](https://bintray.com/docs/images/downloads_by_bintray_96.png)](https://bintray.com/homebrew)\r\n\r\n## Donations\r\nWe accept tips through Gratipay.\r\n\r\n### Shaun Jackman for Linuxbrew\r\n[![Gittip](https://img.shields.io/gratipay/sjackman.svg?style=flat)](https://gratipay.com/sjackman/)\r\n\r\n### Homebrew\r\n[![Gratipay](https://img.shields.io/gratipay/Homebrew.svg?style=flat)](https://gratipay.com/Homebrew/)\r\n","google":"UA-2437900-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
